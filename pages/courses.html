        <h1> Courses informations</h1>
        <p> Ah yes who would't want to know more about the courses that I'm taking. The program that I'm taking is called 
            Computer Information Technology. It basically teaches you on various subjects about (<em>surprise!</em>) computing 
            technulogies like database, networking administration, web technlogy (<em><strong>this</em></strong> thing right here), etc. As short as
            the program is (2 years), the course density and the material is nothing to sneeze at, but at least it's fun and 
            the profs are nice!
